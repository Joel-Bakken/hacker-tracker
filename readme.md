## Description

_{This is a program that is closely based upon a todo list application I created in school. The purpose of the program is to allow a hack-a-thon coordinator to create as many programing teams as they want and to add members to each of those teams}_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Make sure you have Gradle installed on your computer_

_This application requires that you have Gradle installed on your computer. You can download this at: https://gradle.org/. Download this program onto your desktop. Using your computer's built-in terminal interface, go into the hacker-tracker folder.
